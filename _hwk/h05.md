<li>(10 pts) Fill in the information in the header. The following are required to get the 10 "participation" points.

    <p>Also: For paper submission PLEASE submit on ONE SHEET OF PAPER, double-sided if at all possible. If you must submit on two printed sheets write name on BOTH sheets and no staples, paperclips, or folded corners.<br />

 <li> Activation records are stored on the "run-time stack".

 		<li style='margin-bottom:6em;'>(4 pts) Why is a "stack" an appropriate data structure for the storage of activation records?</li>

<li> There are two important parts to every simple recursive function: the base case, and the recursive call that makes progress towards the base case. (There are other forms of recursion, such as "mutual recursion", where <code>foo()</code> calls <code>bar()</code> and <code>bar()</code> calls <code>foo()</code>, but let's set those aside for the moment, and deal only with simple recursive functions). Something that can go wrong with recursion when it is used incorrectly is a stack overflow. Explain two different ways that a recursive function could be writen incorrectly that could leave to stack overflow. Hint: one has something to do with the base case, and the other has to do with the recursive call.

<li> (10 pts) Given a fairly common definition for a <code>struct Node</code> that can be used to make a linked list of int values, along with a conventional implementation of a function that prints the value of the linked list, one per line. Rewrite the function as a recursive function. Hint: the base case is an empty list â€” in that case, do nothing (just return). Recursive call should print the first element on the list, then recurse on the "rest" of the list.
</li>

<pre>
struct Node {
  int data;
  Node *next;
}

void printList(Node *head) {
   for (Node *p=head; p!=NULL; p=p->next) {
      cout << p->data << endl;
   } 
}
