<li>Assume there is a class called <b>Student</b> that has private member variables {<b>string</b> name, <b>int</b> perm}.   Assume that Student has getters and setters for each of these data members getName, setName, getPerm and setPerm, and a constructor that takes name and perm as parameters.  Assume that the class is declare in file <code>student.h</code><p></p>

<ol><li>(8 pts) Write the contents of a .h file for a derived a class called <b>CmpscStudent </b> that inherits from <b>Student</b> and has additional data members including {<b>string</b> ugradDegreeType, <b>bool</b> graduateStudent}.   Include prototypes for a public constructor that initializes all of the data members of <b>CmpscStudent</b> as well as getters (but not setters) for the additional data members of CmpscStudent.  Do not implement these constructors and method "inline".<div style="margin-top:24em;">&#160;</div></li>
<li>(8 pts) Write the function definition for the constructor <b>CmpscStudent</b> that takes as its parameters all of the data members of CmpscStudent, and fully initializes the object being constructed, as it would appears in the .cpp file.  <div style="margin-top:14em;">&#160;</div> </li>
